DATA SCIENCE ROADMAP
🟢 STAGE 1: Foundations
Goal: Understand programming, math, and the data lifecycle.

🧑‍💻 Programming (Python)
Variables, loops, conditionals, functions

Data structures: lists, dicts, sets, tuples

File handling & JSON

Virtual environments

Basic OOP (classes, inheritance)

Learn with: Python, Jupyter, Google Colab

🧮 Math for Data Science
Statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, distributions

Probability: conditional probability, Bayes' Theorem

Linear Algebra: vectors, matrices, dot product

Calculus (basic): derivatives and gradients

📊 Data Basics
What is data? Structured vs unstructured

Types of variables (categorical, continuous, etc.)

Data types in Python (pandas, NumPy)

🟡 STAGE 2: Core Tools & Data Analysis
Goal: Work with real data, clean it, explore it, and extract insights.

🧰 Tools
pandas, NumPy – data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly – visualization

scikit-learn – ML starter

SQL – querying structured data

Git + GitHub – version control

🔍 Data Wrangling & EDA
Missing values, outliers

Data types and conversions

Feature scaling, encoding

Aggregations, groupby, pivot

Correlation, distribution plots

🟠 STAGE 3: Machine Learning
Goal: Build predictive models using clean data.

📦 Supervised Learning
Regression (linear, ridge, lasso)

Classification (logistic regression, KNN, SVM, decision trees, random forest)

📦 Unsupervised Learning
Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN)

Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE)

⚙️ Model Tuning & Evaluation
Cross-validation, grid search

Confusion matrix, ROC, precision/recall

Overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff

🔵 STAGE 4: Advanced Topics
Goal: Go deeper into complex real-world problems.

🧠 Deep Learning (with TensorFlow or PyTorch)
Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs

Image, text, and sequence data

Transfer learning

Custom models

🤖 NLP (Natural Language Processing)
Text cleaning (tokenization, stemming)

Word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT)

Transformers

📈 Time Series
Forecasting methods (ARIMA, Prophet)

Seasonal trends

Lag features

🟣 STAGE 5: Real-World Projects & MLOps
Goal: Build, deploy, and monitor data science solutions.

🚀 Projects
End-to-end ML pipelines

Kaggle competitions

Domain-specific (finance, health, retail, etc.)

🛠 Deployment & MLOps
Model serving: Flask, FastAPI

Docker & Kubernetes (optional)

CI/CD for ML

MLflow or Weights & Biases (tracking)
