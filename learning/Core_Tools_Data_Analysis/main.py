#pytorch
# It is a powerful library that provides a flexible and efficient way to work with tensors and perform computations on GPUs.
# It is widely used in the field of computer vision, natural language processing, and other areas of artificial intelligence.
# It is known for its dynamic computation graph, which allows for easy debugging and experimentation.
# It is also used for building and training deep learning models, and it provides a wide range of pre-trained models and tools for transfer learning.
